I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Economics at the University of Bristol. My passion in research was sparked during my sophomore year of undergraduate studies, where I was fortunate to delve into research under the supervision of my mentor. My research interests include, but are not limited to, Labor Economics, Development Economics, and Game Theory. I aspire to pursue a PhD degree in the future, fully aware that the path to a doctorate is often fraught with challenges.

At the heart of my current research lies the impact of robots and artificial intelligence (AI) on the economy. I have already made a modest stride in my academic career by publishing a paper in a peer-reviewed journal (ABS3, SSCI Q2). Additionally, I have several working papers that are under review or in progress.

Please feel free to reach out to me for potential collaborations or to exchange ideas and insights. I am looking forward to the opportunity to connect and to jointly navigate the fascinating world of economics.
